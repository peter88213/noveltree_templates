# Departure

## Call to Adventure

The hero begins in a situation of normality from which some information 
is received that acts as a call to head off into the unknown. 

## Refusal of the Call

Often when the call is given, the future hero first refuses to heed it. 
This may be from a sense of duty or obligation, fear, insecurity, a sense 
of inadequacy, or any of a range of reasons that work to hold the person 
in his current circumstances. 

## Supernatural Aid

Once the hero has committed to the quest, consciously or unconsciously, 
their guide and magical helper appears or becomes known. More often than not, 
this supernatural mentor will present the hero with one or more talismans or 
artifacts that will aid them later in their quest.

## Crossing the 1st threshold

This is the point where the hero actually crosses into the field of adventure, 
leaving the known limits of their world and venturing into an unknown and 
dangerous realm where the rules and limits are unknown.

## Belly of the Whale

The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero's known world 
and self. By entering this stage, the person shows a willingness to undergo a metamorphosis. 
When first entering the stage the hero may encounter a minor danger or setback.

# Initiation

## Road of Trials/Ordeal

The road of trials is a series of tests that the hero must undergo to begin 
the transformation. Often the hero fails one or more of these tests, 
which often occur in threes. Eventually, the hero will overcome these trials 
and move on to the next step.

## Meeting with the Goddess.

This is where the hero gains items given to him that will help him in the future. 

## Woman as the Temptress

In this step, the hero faces those temptations, often of a physical or pleasurable 
nature, that may lead them to abandon or stray from their quest, which does not 
necessarily have to be represented by a woman. A woman is a metaphor for the physical 
or material temptations of life since the hero-knight was often tempted by lust from 
his spiritual journey.

## Atonement with the father

In this step, the hero must confront and be initiated by whatever holds the 
ultimate power in their life. In many myths and stories, this is the father 
or a father figure who has life and death power. This is the center point of 
the journey. All the previous steps have been moving into this place, all that 
follow will move out from it. Although this step is most frequently symbolized 
by an encounter with a male entity, it does not have to be a maleâ€”just someone 
or something with incredible power.

## Apotheosis.

This is the point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved. 
Armed with this new knowledge and perception, the hero is resolved and ready 
for the more difficult part of the adventure.

## Ultimate Boon

The ultimate boon is the achievement of the goal of the quest. 
It is what the hero went on the journey to get. All the previous steps serve 
to prepare and purify the hero for this step since in many myths the boon 
is something transcendent like the elixir of life itself, or a plant 
that supplies immortality, or the holy grail.

# Return

## Refusal of the return

Having found bliss and enlightenment in the other world, the hero may not want 
to return to the ordinary world to bestow the boon onto their fellow beings.

## Magic Flight

Sometimes the hero must escape with the boon if it is something that the gods 
have been jealously guarding. It can be just as adventurous and dangerous 
returning from the journey as it was to go on it. 

## Rescue from Without

Just as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest, 
often they must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to 
everyday life, especially if the hero has been wounded or weakened by the experience.

## Crossing the Return Threshold

Campbell says in The Hero with a Thousand Faces that "The returning hero, 
to complete his adventure, must survive the impact of the world."
The goal of the return is to retain the wisdom gained on the quest 
and to integrate it into society.

## Master of the Two Worlds

For a human hero, it may mean achieving a balance between the material 
and spiritual. The person has become comfortable and competent in both 
the inner and outer worlds.

## Freedom to live

In this step, mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death, 
which in turn is the freedom to live. This is sometimes referred to 
as living in the moment, neither anticipating the future nor regretting the past.
