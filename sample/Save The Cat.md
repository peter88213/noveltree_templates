# Act I

## Opening Image

The Opening Image should give an impression of the tone, mood, type, and scope.

## Theme Stated

A secondary character states the theme of the story, usually in an offhand manner.

## Set-up

The Set-up shows the hero's world before the change that the story will bring. 
All major characters in the A-story are introduced or hinted at. 
The set-up should present the "Six Things That Need Fixing"—the things missing 
or need to be changed in the hero's life, from character flaws to basic needs to wishes. 

## Catalyst

The Catalyst is a life-changing moment, something that presents the journey to the hero 
or makes it impossible for the hero to continue in their current stasis. This is also 
referred to as the Inciting Incident or the Call to Adventure.

## Debate

During this section, the hero debates what to do about the Catalyst, and sometimes refuses 
the challenge, only to accept it later.

# Act II

## Break into Two

The hero makes the choice to go on the adventure. This propels them into Act II, 
the antithesis of Act I.

## B Story

The B story is a break from the main story and carries the theme of the story—usually 
in line with the A story but different in scope. It is often a love story, and new characters 
may be introduced. The role of the B story here is to give the readers a breather 
after the Break into Two.

## Fun and Games

The Fun and Games section, the first half of Act Two, provides "the promise of the premise"—the 
fun heart of the story, which isn't as concerned with the forward progress of the story. 
It is often lighter in tone than the rest of the story. 

## Midpoint

The Midpoint is either a false victory or a false defeat, through which the stakes are raised. 
Often, the All Is Lost beat will inversely correspond to the Midpoint: for example if the Midpoint 
is a false defeat, the All Is Lost moment will be a false victory.

## Bad Guys close in

Things begin to get worse for the hero during this section, while the bad guys regroup. The hero 
faces increasingly complex and seemingly insurmountable obstacles to his or her goal.

## All is lost

This is the lowest beat in the story—the hero's life falls apart, and there is no hope. 
Often there is a "whiff of death," anything that involves a death (for example, the hint 
of suicide or the death of a mentor).

## Dark night of the soul

This is the darkness before the dawn, when the hero wallows absolute hopelessness—before 
picking themself up, digging deep and finding a solution.

# Act III

## Break into Three

The A and B stories intertwine and help the hero to find the solution. 
The final act (synthesis) begins.

## Finale

The journey is resolved as the hero applies the lessons they have learned, the old world 
turns over, a new world is created, and the bad guys are dealt with in ascending order 
(from minor importance to greater importance). It's not enough for the hero to succeed, 
they must change the world.

## Final Image

The Final Image mirrors the Opening Image, showing that a change has occurred.
